# npx nakedjsx

`npx nakedjsx` is used to build a NakedJSX project.

It is essentially a thin invocation wrapper around
@nakedjsx/core and the official plugins. If it is run
on files that belong to a project that itself depends
on @nakedjsx/core, then the build will be handled by
the project's installation of NakedJSX.

Please report any issues at the [@nakedjsx/core issue tracker](https://github.com/NakedJSX/core/issues).
